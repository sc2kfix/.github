## Welcome to the sc2kfix project!
sc2kfix is a project reverse engineering SimCity 2000 Special Edition for Windows and developing a bugfix and modding plugin to patch core game and compatibility bugs as well as enabling the development of new quality of life and gameplay features. The main repository, [sc2kfix](https://github.com/sc2kfix/sc2kfix), contains the C++ source code and required binary blobs for the sc2kfix plugin itself.

Development is led by [@araxestroy](https://github.com/araxestroy), with code and reverse engineering contributions from other members of the GitHub and Simtropolis communities.

A full user guide to the sc2kfix plugin can be found on our website, https://sc2fkix.net.

## Reverse engineering
We are have set up wiki for collaboration on reverse engineering SimCity 2000 at https://wiki.s2kfix.net. If you have reverse engineering experience and would like to contribute, please contact @araxestroy, as account creation on the wiki is currently locked down to prevent spam.

All existing and future reverse engineering work is being done against the 1996 Special Edition release of the game for Windows 95. The 1995 CD Collection release is not being targeted due to major changes in the game's internal layout between that version and the 1996 Special Edition release. Small amounts of reverse engineering work are being done against the DOS version when required to determine if a behaviour differs from that of the Windows versions, but these are not being as thoroughly documented or expanded upon as the Windows 95 version.

## Contributing
We welcome all kinds of reverse engineering and programming knowledge! You can open a pull request or issue on any of our repositories if you have a bug to report, a suggestion to make, or a fix or feature to contribute. For code contributions, please note that all official builds of the plugin (including automated CI builds) are made using Visual Studio 2022 with C++14 compatibility.
