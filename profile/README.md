## Welcome to the sc2kfix project!
sc2kfix is a project reverse engineering SimCity 2000 Special Edition for Windows and developing a bugfix and modding plugin to patch core game and compatibility bugs as well as enabling the development of new quality of life and gameplay features. The main repository, [sc2kfix](https://github.com/sc2kfix/sc2kfix), contains the C++ source code and required binary blobs for the sc2kfix plugin itself.

Development is led by [@araxestroy](https://github.com/araxestroy), with code and reverse engineering contributions from other members of the GitHub and Simtropolis communities.

## Reverse engineering
We are working on setting up a repository with a wiki for collaboration on reverse engineering SimCity 2000. All existing and future work is being done against the 1996 Special Edition release of the game for Windows 95. The 1995 CD Collection release is not recommended due to major changes in the game's internal layout compared the final 1996 Special Edition release.

## Contributing
We welcome all kinds of reverse engineering and programming knowledge! You can open a pull request or issue on any of our repositories if you have a bug to report, a suggestion to make, or a fix or feature to contribute. For code contributions, please note that all official builds of the plugin are made using Visual Studio 2022 with C++14 compatibility.
